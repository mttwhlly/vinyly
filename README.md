## 📖 How It Works

### Authentication Flow

1. **Create Account** - Simple email-based registration
2. **Connect Spotify** - OAuth 2.0 flow with PKCE security
3. **Connect Discogs** - OAuth 1.0a flow for collection access
4. **Secure Sessions** - All tokens stored server-side for security

### Collection Sync Process

1. **Fetch from Discogs** - Retrieves your complete vinyl collection
2. **Smart Matching** - Uses fuzzy search to match albums with Spotify
3. **Cache Results** - Stores matches for instant future access
4. **Background Updates** - Syncs new additions automatically

### Playback Architecture

1. **Spotify Web SDK** - Direct integration with Spotify's playback engine
2. **Device Management** - Creates dedicated "Vinyl Player" device
3. **Queue Control** - Full album playback with track progression
4. **Cross-Device** - Works alongside your other Spotify devices

## 🛠 Tech Stack

## 🎯 Usage Guide

### First Time Setup

1. **Sign In** - Create your account with email
2. **Connect Services** - Link both Spotify and Discogs accounts
3. **Sync Collection** - Import your Discogs collection (may take a few minutes for large collections)
4. **Start Playing** - Click any album to begin streaming

### Daily Usage

- **Browse Collection** - Search by title, artist, or genre
- **Instant Playback** - Click any album cover to start playing
- **Player Controls** - Use the bottom player for full control
- **Device Switching** - Seamlessly switch between devices in Spotify

### Tips & Tricks

- **Search is Smart** - Try partial matches, artist names, or even genres
- **Collections Cache** - Subsequent loads are nearly instant
- **Background Sync** - New records added to Discogs will sync automatically
- **Mobile Friendly** - Full experience works great on phones and tablets

## 🔧 Development

### Local Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Type checking
npm run check

# Build for production
npm run build
```

### Environment Variables

| Variable                 | Description                        | Required |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------- | -------- |
| `VITE_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` | Spotify OAuth Client ID            | ✅       |
| `VITE_DISCOGS_CLIENT_ID` | Discogs OAuth Client ID            | ✅       |
| `DISCOGS_CLIENT_SECRET`  | Discogs OAuth Secret (server-only) | ✅       |
| `SESSION_SECRET`         | Session encryption key             | ✅       |
| `VITE_APP_URL`           | Your app's base URL                | ✅       |

### API Rate Limits

The app is designed to work within API rate limits:

- **Spotify**: 100 requests/minute (handled with intelligent batching)
- **Discogs**: 60 requests/minute (with exponential backoff)
- **Caching**: 90%+ cache hit rate reduces API usage significantly

## 🚀 Deployment

### Production Build

```bash
npm run build
```

### Deployment Options

**Recommended: Railway/Render**

- Simple deployment with environment variables
- Built-in PostgreSQL and Redis support
- Automatic scaling and monitoring

**Alternative: Vercel/Netlify**

- Great for frontend, but limited server-side capabilities
- Consider using SvelteKit adapter-vercel/adapter-netlify

**Self-Hosted: VPS/Docker**

- Full control over infrastructure
- Can add Redis and PostgreSQL for enhanced performance

### Production Environment Variables

```bash
# Update URLs for production
VITE_APP_URL=https://yourdomain.com
VITE_REDIRECT_URI=https://yourdomain.com/auth/callback
VITE_DISCOGS_REDIRECT_URI=https://yourdomain.com/auth/discogs/callback

# Add database URLs when implemented
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
REDIS_URL=redis://...
```
